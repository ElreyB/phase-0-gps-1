## Prostko reflection GPS 1.1 ##

1. Before this GPS I was struggling with the difference between git fetch and gut pull, and also pushing to a remote. Or the inner workings of pushing to a remote, not the action.

2. The fetch and pull concepts were definitly clarified by the teamwork Elrey and I put in during the session. We both were pretty much lost, so we researched and came together to figure the thing out. 
3. We asked each other questions constantly, whether about syntax or spelling or what the next step was, whatever. It felt more like two people searching through the woods together, rather than a teacher student dynamic.
4. Git can become a confusing in a hurry when something doesn't work the way it should. Then it seems unfriendly. But using the help command and researching online to firgure out some answers can be rewarding.
5. It was a great expirience. Everybody is a little different, and it's always fun, but I think this pairing session was so great because we both were knocking it out together, both sides just trying to tackle the problem rather than being superior or something. I think there was real synergy this session.
