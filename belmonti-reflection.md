What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Since this is my second time doing this I didn't have any struggles with Git concepts. At least the ones we ere using.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
We had trouble getting our image to show but we figure out that is was the fact we were using relavtive path and the website server didn't have that path. When we push it to Github it worked just fine becasue it has the path to the image.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
OUr guide was unable to make the GPS. Me and my though, trying to figure out why the image wasn't loading, talk about what it wasn't working and tried different things to get it to work.

What still confuses you about Git?
Going through this a second time made Git concepts mor clear.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
This time around, with out our guide, I think me and my pair, Eric, did really well. Week kept communicating to each other which made it easier to figure things out.
